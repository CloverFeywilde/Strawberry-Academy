# Strawberry Academy
## A Cozy & Cute Urban Fantasy TTRPG

### Intro
Strawberry Academy is a cozy & minimalistic reimagining of the Fantasy Table Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG). This system fuses the engagement of a stat building school life simulator, with the thrills of weilding spells and slinging steel against foes in class driven combat. Strawberry Academy aims to create an environment where cozy character interactions can take center stage, while also condensing and simplifying the complexities that come with a more traditional Fantasy TTRPG.

The goal of this system is to make the joy of TTRPGs more accessible for busy people that just want to have fun and build cute stories together with their friends.
