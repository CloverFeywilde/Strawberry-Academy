# Reborn in Another World

## Handmade with love for: Haku <3
Here's the rules for your reference. Follow along where you can, and try not to panic, I promise I'll explain and go super slowly. I promise it's not super complicated when you start playing. 

## Combat System
The combat system for the Isekai Realm is a light, fluffy mixture of traditional TTRPG and Trading Card Game(TCG) mechanics. This system is both card based and turn based. Cards are used to represent what options a Character can take on any given turn, while their character sheets represents the character itself.

__**What you'll need**__
Combat is played using the same single deck of Tarot cards that you used in the Academy section of the game. Here in combat, this deck is referred to as the "Field Deck" and is placed in the center of table.

Next to each player, they should have decks of no more than 15 cards each. These decks are referred to as "Player Decks", and the cards for them are aquired during the Academy Life segment as rewards for participating in successful Strawberry!'s 

Each Player Student enters combat in pairs with 1 NPC Student. Each Player Student is given a combat class, referred to as their "Main Class", and each NPC Student is given a class as well, referred to as the "Sub Class". The Player Student controls the actions from both members of their pair.

Each player is given a total of 6 Combat Skills:
 - 1 Ultimate Skill (from your Main Class),
 - 3 Skills from your Main Class
 - 2 Skills from your Sub Class.

## Flow of Combat
__**Pre-Combat**__
- Combat in the Isekai Realm begins with a "Soft Check" of the Headmaster's choosing. Each player rolls a 6 sided dice with modifiers included to determine the turn order. If two or more players get the same role, then re-roll. If exactly two players get the same role, then flip a coin to see which goes first.
- At this time, during Pre-Combat, the Headmaster can place special rules and restrictions on combat. This should be done sparingly, and should only be done to mechanically represent the story narrative. A typical example would include certain abilities and actions costing more or less.
- Once turn order has been decided, everyone at the table will draw 7 cards from the Field Deck. Once this has been done Combat can begin.

__**Draw Phase**__
The Turn Player starts by drawing a card from the Field Deck.

__**Extra Draw Phase**__
The Turn Player can draw a card from their own Player Deck. As a cost for doing this, they must first discard a card from their hand. Also be mindful that your Player Deck is: 
- Limited to 15 Cards max
- Is a Limited resource and is difficult to refill.
- Unless the Headmaster chooses, hands and Player Deck counts remain between combat encounters.

__**Exchange Phase**__
At this time, if your hand is lacking, you may ask your fellow Party Members for assistance. 1 Card can be exchanged from the Turn Player's hand for another in another Player's hand. You can only do 1 Exchange per turn. Please follow the below guidelines for doing exchanges:
- Start by asking for what type of Card you need, and ask your Party Members if they have it.
- No Player should feel obligated to trade if they don't want to or it doesn't benefit them.
- Don't reveal your hand to another player while doing an exchange.

__**Skill Phase**__
At this time you may activate 1 availible Skill on your character sheet. Skills each have the following parameters:

- _Name_ - The name of the skill. Represented in bold with a colon. For example, "**Dark Deal:**"
- _Action Type_ - The Action Type Represents when this skill can be used. Action Types are surrounded in Parenthesis. For example, (Standard Action) There are several types of actions:
	1)  (Standard Action) | These are activated normally by paying the cost during your Skill Phase and following the instructions on the Skill. 
	2)  (Passive Action) | These Skills are activated automatically and are required. Follow the instructions on the Skill for more info.
	3)  (Free Action) | These Skills have no activation cost and can be activated like normal during the Skill Phase.
	4)  (Quick Action) | These Skills can be activated outside of the Skill Phase, and are generally a reaction to something that happens outside of your turn. Follow the instructions carefully on the Skill.
- _Activation Cost_ - Represented in brackets. You must pay this cost before the Skill can be activated. For example, [discard 1 card from your hand] 
- _Activation Condition_ - Activation conditions are special conditions that must be present, and are considered part of the Activation Cost. They are written inside of the Activation Cost square brackets, and are italicized and surrounded by dashes. For example [ _-Your hand must be lower than your Opponent's-_]
- Effect - this is the Skill effect. Written in plain text. Follow the instructions carefully.

__**Attack Phase**__
If you've not dealt damage to your opponent by this point, you may enter the Attack Phase. Follow the below steps to perform an attack.
1) To attack take 1 card from your hand that has a number on it and place it on the table face up. 
2) Following this, the player you're attacking can attempt to block your attack. To block an attack your opponent must play a card from their hand that has the same suit or number. If the attack is blocked, the attack phase ends. 
3) If the attack was successful, damage is calculated. Damage is equal to your Character's matching Stat of attacking Card's Suit. Multiply this number by 2 if your Attack Card matches your Class Suit + any additional modifiers from Skills.

__**End Phase**__
Proceed to end your turn. Ocasionally special skills can be activated during this phase.
