# Academy Life Mechanics
A tallented young artist smirks confidently as she puts the final touches on her best painting yet, the fruits of two weeks worth of dedicated work, and a surefire success for her midterm. With just a few more hours, it'll be ready for the deadline first thing in the morning. However, a sudden knock at the door leaves her carefully laid evening plans in shambles, as her girlfriend shows up with surprise plans for a night on the town. 

Should the studious young painter put aside her work for the evening and enjoy a sweet night out? After all this is her girlfriend, what better of a chance to strengthen her Charm and Empathy by putting one of the most important people's feelings first?

 But school is important! Perhaps it would be best to take the risk and to try talking through the situation. Spending the evening focusing on her studies would be an excellent exercise in Determination and Knowledge. Surely her girlfriend will understand... or will she? Does the young artist have the empathy and communcation skills to navigate such a situation successfully? Or would it simply be better to enjoy the night and let things fall as they may?

## Student Stats
There are four primary stats that serve as the foundation for every mechanic in the game, both social and combat. They are: Determination, Charm, Knowledge, and Empathy. These stats determine which students will be interested in you, what sorts of school activities you'll be more likely to succeed in, as well as can help inform what type of person your student will grow into as the journey progresses. Below follows a brief description of each stat:

### Determination
A measure of strenuous physical endurance, as well as emotional fortitude. Any time a student wishes to push themselves beyond their limits in any way, and would find themselves to be under any kind of pressure, determination will be required to forge ahead! Determination is what your student will need to excel on the volleyball team, pull an all nighter on an exam, and to break out of their comfort zone and succeed at something they've never tried before.

### Charm
Measures how easily you can gain the favor of others, and how successfully you can pursuade others to join your cause. Students with a lot of charm will find they have a large potential pool of character interactions to choose from, and will find they can find a way to quickly appeal to myriads of personalities. Charming students will find that opening up to new people comes second nature, and for this they're often put at the head of the pack as influencers and leaders.

### Knowledge
Knowledge acts as a gate that will make or break your student's success in any specialized activity, be it academeic or creative. A well learned student will find themselves able to quickly get the feel of a new activity, and will find themselves able gain access to rare opportunities that few others can! Additionally, students that are well learned will find that they're frequently relied upon by others, which can lead to all sorts of unique opportunities.

### Empathy
Empathy is a determinant for how deeply students can relate with one another, and how successful their relationships are in the long run. Empathetic students will find that they're able to solve the problems of others, and are able to turn bad situations into opportunities that can act in their favor. Empathetic students are drawn towards the conflict and strife of others, and will find that doing so can bring them unexpected opportunities and assistance when they need it the most.

## Character Encounters
WIP

## Strawberry!
'Strawberry!' is a special style of social encounter that plays a central role in driving a student's growth. Additionally, Strawberry! Keeps players on their feet and adds an opportunity for interactivity between Player Students, regardless of which is currently the Main Character.

Strawberry! is a special game state that begins any time the headmaster chooses and it follows the flow outlined below. Strawberry! would typically be used whenever a Player Student is challenged with a situation where the outcome can't be reasonably determined by reviewing their stats. Whenever possible, favor using stats to determine the outcome of a situation. Strawberry! is a system that's best used conservatively. 

__**1) Declare Strawberry**__
The headmaster begins by declaring "Strawberry!". Whenever Strawberry! is declared, there's no turning back or backing out. The Headmaster then summarize the challenge in one or two sentences: 
Example 1: "You attempt to convince your girlfriend to reschedule her surprise date without hurting her feelings."
Example 2: "You've been out all day and you're exhausted, but you attempt to stay awake all night and study for an exam in the morning."

__**2) Set the difficulty**__
Determine how difficult the challenge is by observing the current Main Character's stats and comparing them against the Challenger Stat. The Challenger Stat can come from another student or from a stat assigned to particular activity.
**Note: These stats, if possible, should all be determined in advance:**

There are three difficulties, Easy, Medium, and Hard. 
Easy: When you're above the Challenger Stat by more than 1 but less than 4
Medium: When you're equal or are within 1 point (+/-) of the Challenger Stat
Hard: When you're below the Challenger Stat by more than 1 point.

Example 1:  You have an Empathy of 2 and your girlfriend's Empathy is also 2. Because these stats are the same, the difficulty would be set to Medium.
Example 2: You have a Determination of 5 but the test requires a Determination of 7. Because your Determination is 2 lower than the test, the difficulty would be set to Hard.

__** 3) Invite Player Students to participate**__
At this time, the Headmaster will set the participant limit, and then the Main Character can invite any other Player Student of their choosing to participate. Each participating student must contribute 1 Minor Arcana card to the roll. If the roll succeeds all participating students will recieve a reward at the resolution.

__**4) (Optional) Main Character chooses Minor Arcana**__
At this time, the Main Character can choose to contribute a minor arcana to the roll.

__** 5) Roll! **__
Roll a 1d6 and determine the outcome based on the below guidelines:

Easy: 1, 3, 5
Medium: 2, 4
Hard: 6

__** 6) (Optional) Main Character can respond with additional Minor Arcana**__
At this time, if the Main Character has any additional Minor Arcana that can be played, they can do so. 
**Note: Paige, Queen, and King of any suit are the only cards that allow you to do this.**

__** 7) Resolution **__
The outcome is determined at this time. Either Pass or Fail. If the result is Pass, each Participating Student is rewarded with 1 Strawberry for an easy, 2 for a medium, and 3 for a hard.

Following the resolution step, the Headmaster will give a brief summary of what just happened, and at that time, the Main Character can Role Play it. Additionally, any participating characters that are around will have a small chance to add a bit of flavor RP to the interaction if they'd like.
